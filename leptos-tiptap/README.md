# leptos-tiptap

Enables the integration of [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) instances into your [leptos](https://leptos.dev/) projects.

This is a rather low-level dependency. Use it if you want to create your own editor experience.

If you are searching for a ready-to-use text editor, check out the leptos component
library [Leptonic](https://leptonic.dev/), which already incorporates this crate to define an editor.

The currently used tiptap version is `2.1.7`

Check out the [repository](https://github.com/lpotthast/leptos-tiptap) for further instructions on how to use this
dependency directly.
