# leptos-tiptap

Enables the integration of [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) instances into your [leptos](https://leptos.dev/) projects.

## Usage

This is a rather low-level dependency. Use it if you want to create your own editor experience.
You will need the actual tiptap JS code in your application.
Check out `leptos-tiptap-build` as well as the `leptos-tiptap` examples ("demo-csr" and "demo-ssr"), all available in the [repository](https://github.com/lpotthast/leptos-tiptap),
to get a grasp of how the tiptap JS files can be added to a build.

## Integrated

If you are searching for a ready-to-use text editor, check out the leptos component
library [Leptonic](https://leptonic.dev/), which already incorporates this crate to define an editor.
